VELOCITY THEME SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER

To add a proper screenshot:
1. Create a screenshot.png file (1200x900px recommended)
2. Take a screenshot of the theme's homepage
3. Save it as screenshot.png in the theme root directory

For now, WordPress will show a default placeholder.

Recommended screenshot specs:
- Format: PNG or JPG
- Size: 1200x900 pixels (4:3 ratio)
- File name: screenshot.png
- Location: /wp-content/themes/velocity/screenshot.png
- Content: Show the homepage design with hero section, services, and footer visible

You can use any image editing software or online tools to create the screenshot.
